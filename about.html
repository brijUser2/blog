    <td>  Mike Trivedi founded his software company - Trivedi Solutions - in 
  Valley Forge, PA in the early '90s.  Since then he has provided expert 
  consulting services to many companies, including about a dozen S&P500 
  companies, as well as members of the DOW30, FTSE50 and CAC40.
  <br>
  He has also built a large number of custom apps.  One of his apps achieved
   an <b>IBM ServerProven<sup>TM</sup></b> designation and was sold to EU clients.
  <br>
  In 2018 Mike became the solo bootstrapped founder of <b>Brij</b>, a noCode 
  Database System: think <i>AirTable</i> but with real Database capabilities, including:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Table/Schema Design</li>
    <li>Form Design</li>
    <li>DataView Design</li>
    <li>Infinite Capacity</li>
  </ul>
<br>
  Sometime during the COVID lockdown, Mike ported Brij (then about 40k loc) from 
  Java to FSharp.  Since then he has been a Functional Programming (FP) enthusiast 
  and advocate.
