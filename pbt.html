	<h1 class='title'>PBT: Developers must NOT write tests</h1>
	<i>or,</i><br>
	<h2 class='title'>Hands On: Using FsCheck to test a Windows Client UI</h2>
	</center>
<p>
Every once in a while, something new comes out of the world of Functional Programming (FP) which 
	takes even seasoned developers absolutely by surprise.
<p>
Here's the typical reaction from (even a Senior) developer, one with some FP exposure:<br>
1) The developer will read something and say <i>"What?"</i>  Then he'll go silent and glassy-eyed.<br>
2) After a few more minutes of reading, the developer will emit a low whistle.<br>
3) Finally he'll say: "How is that even <i>possible</i>?
<p>
I felt that way when I first read about FSharp Type Providers (see this, this and this).  
	More recently I felt the same emotions when I encountered Haskell <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck'>QuickCheck</a>.

	<p>

<h3>Avoid the heavy Lifting</h3>
In this article I am assuming zero FP knowledge.  You might be working in 
C# and using the FsCheck dotnet library, or any other flavor of QuickCheck.  <br>
I will show you how to create a State Machine Model mapping your API to  use FsCheck to autoGenerate and run tests.
<p>

<h3>What it is</h3>
	<a href='https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck'>QuickCheck</a> is a Haskell library which allows you to generate hundreds, even thousands of random 
tests.  You just set it up, give it a property to test and it's almost as if  ten mini developers in the compiler begin to write and execute tests immediately.<p>

Here is how <a href='https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quviq-testing.pdf'>John Hughes</a>, one of QuickCheck's original developers, describes the library:<p>

<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
Here’s an interesting little experiment. Try asking a room full of software developers, "who really, really loves testing?" Very, very few will raise their hands. For
whatever reason, most developers see testing as more of a chore than a pleasure;
few go to work in the morning raring to write some test cases. And yet, testing
is a vital part of software development! Why should it be so unpopular?<p>
To understand why, imagine writing a suite of unit tests for software with,
say, n different features. Probably you will write 3–4 test cases per feature. This
is perfectly manageable—it’s a linear amount of work. But, we all know you will
not find all of your bugs that way, because some bugs can only be triggered by a
pair of features interacting. <p>Now, you could go on to write test cases for every pair
of features—but this is a quadratic amount of work, which is much less appealing.<p>
And even if you do so, you will still not find all of your bugs—some bugs only
appear when three features interact! Testing for all of these would involve O(n<sup>3</sup>)
work, which is starting to sound very unappealing indeed—and this is before we
even start to consider race conditions, which by definition involve at least two
features interacting, and even worse, only manifest themselves occasionally even
in test cases that can provoke them in principle!
<p>
This is the fundamental problem with testing—you can never be “done”. No
wonder it’s not so popular. What is the answer to this conundrum? Simply this:<br>
<center><b>DON’T WRITE TESTS!</b></center><br>
But of course, we can’t just deliver untested code to users. So the message is
actually more nuanced: don’t write tests—generate them!
<p>
This is how I have spent much of my time in recent years, working with a test
case generator called QuickCheck. QuickCheck was first developed in Haskell
by Koen Claessen and myself (Claessen and Hughes, 2000), and has become
the testing tool of choice among Haskell developers. The idea has been widely
emulated—Wikipedia now lists no fewer than 35 reimplementations of the basic
idea, for languages ranging from C to Swift.

<p>
QuickCheck and its ports have been used in Real-World situations at many companies including Volvo and AWS.  Even though this library has been around for a few years, like most cutting-edge research, 'Main Street' has been slow in adopting PBT.  This is good news: you can be one of the devs on the <i>avant garde</i>!

<p>  If you're like me you'll be quite happy to front-load the effort of learning a new testing framework if the long
	term benefits include not writing tests at all!

<h3>Required Reading</h3>
Reading these two short articles will help you in your first attempt at PBT:
<ol>
  <li>John Hughes' (short, very readable) paper: Experiences with <a href='https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/232550/local_232550.pdf'>QuickCheck</a>:
Testing the Hard Stuff and Staying Sane</li>
  <li>FsCheck Docs: <a href='https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck//StatefulTestingNew.html'>Model</a>-based Testing</li>
</ol>
I found both of these two be an easy read.
<p>
  If you wish to dive deeper there are additional links at the bottom of this article.
<p>
<h3>State-Model Based Testing</h3>

After reading all the docs thoroughly I came to the conclusion that the Model-Based approach was the easiest to implement as a newbie.

<p>
  <center><img src="./assets/hughesStateMachine.png"></center>
<p>
<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
We test stateful systems by generating sequences of calls to the API under test, just like the test cases that developers write by hand. But we also model the state of the system abstractly, and define model state transitions for each operation in the API. 
<p>Using these state transition functions, we compute the model state at every point in a test. We define postconditions for each API call, relating the actual result of the call to the model state (see the Figure above). A test passes if all postconditions hold.

Easy to reason about, use Spreadsheet txt + link; use Hughes' img + link, Easy to connect to app's functionality.

<br>
	Another description I found helpful in understanding the mechanics of building a State Machine Model is provided in Grant Slatton's excellent <a href='https://grantslatton.com/rowzero-property-testing'>article</a> on PBT.  <p>
    Grant is a founding engineer at <a href='https://rowzero.io/'>Row Zero</a>, the world's fastest spreadsheet.  He formerly worked at AWS and used tools like QuickCheck to formally verify the S3 filesystem.<br>
	
<figure class="quote">
  <blockquote>
Blackbox reference-model testing is the best and most powerful method. This involves testing the real implementation of something against a reference model. <p>Typically, the reference model will be much less efficient than the real one, or lacking some functionality.
	<p>
An example of this is how we store the values of the cells in the spreadsheet. You could imagine a solution that is just a giant hash table whose key is the cell name, and the value is the contents of that cell. 
<p>In practice, we do something much more efficient than this, but our optimized implementation should still behave like a simple hash table.
<br>
So we can make a test that does random cell inserts, updates, and deletes to the real data structure, and a simple hash table reference. Then, at the end of the test, we compare them to make sure they have the same values in each cell.

<h3>A closer look at the FsC State Model Test example</h3>
  Like FSharp code, the Model-Based example shown in the <a href='https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/StatefulTestingNew.html'>man page</a> is short but complete.<p>
    The entire test is just about 25 lines of code, but there is a lot happenning.<br>
    For those new to FSharp syntax, I ask you to read the man page slowly (especially the documentation part)<p>
      There are only three important types used in the example:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Machine&lt;TypeUnderTest, ModelType&gt;</li>
        <li>Setup&lt;TypeUnderTest, ModelType&gt;</li>
        <li>Operation&lt;TypeUnderTest, ModelType&gt;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The code flow is dead simple:<p>
        <i>Create the Machine <br>
        |> Setup the Machine <br>
        |> Create Operations for Test and Actual Models.</i>
        <p>FsCheck will do the rest (run the tests first on the Test Model, then on the Actual Model, and then run the Checks)
  <p>

	<center><img src="./assets/CounterTy.png" width='100%'></center>
<p>

    The <b>Counter</b> type represents the Actual Model and is just a wrapper around a stored mutable state  <b>int</b>, and has methods <b>Inc</b> and <b>Dec</b> which return the state.
    <p>
<center><img src="./assets/spec.png" width='100%'></center>
<p>
    The main action in the example takes place in the Operations <b>inc</b> and <b>dec</b> shown above.<br>
    Operations have a function <b>Run</b> which runs the Action on the test Model, and a method <b>Check</b> which runs it on the Actual System; and then compares the result with the results of the test model.
  <p>
    <b>Please note:</b><br> If you find Fsharp code syntax hard to decipher with (and are familiar with C), John Hughes has provided a simple example of testing a queue implemented as a circular buffer in C in <a href='https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/john-hughes/quviq-testing.pdf'>this</a> paper.  Perhaps you can read it before the FsCheck man page.

<p>
<h3>The Production System under test</h3>

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrivediEnterprisesInc/TrivediEnterprisesInc.github.io/refs/heads/main/img/0SP.png" width='75%' style='border:1px solid'></center>

<p>
The system we are currently testing is the Desktop Client UI of a Database System.<br>  The screenshot above shows how the Desktop window looks.  It is a Windows Form with a multiple document interface (MDI) <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.mdilayout?view=netframework-4.8.1'>layout</a>.  This allows the devoper to open multiple child windows, just like the Windows desktop opens a new window for each icon clicked.<p>
The internal API for the Desktop UI element is as follows:<p>

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;width:100%;border: 2px solid black;">
    <caption><center><h4>Desktop API</h4></center></caption>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;border-top: 2px solid black;">
    <th style="width:20%;">API Call</th>
    <th style="width:40%;">Trigger</th>
    <th>Desc</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
    <td>AddIcon()</td>
    <td>RightClick on Dsktop &gt;&gt; PopupMenu &gt;&gt; "Add Icon"</td>
    <td>Allows the dev to add a new Icon to the Desktop</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
    <td>RemoveIcon()</td>
    <td>RightClick on Icon &gt;&gt; PopupMenu &gt;&gt; "Remove Icon"</td>
    <td>Allows the dev to remove a specific Icon from the Desktop</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
    <td>ChangeLbl()</td>
    <td>IconRightClick &gt;&gt; PopupMenu &gt;&gt; "Change Label"</td>
    <td>Allows the dev to change a specific Icon's label text</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
    <td>OpenDb()</td>
    <td>IconDblClick</td>
    <td>Opens the Database associated with the icon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
    <td>OpenDevView()</td>
    <td>IconRightClick &gt;&gt; PopupMenu &gt;&gt; "Open in DeveloperView"</td>
    <td>Opens the Database associated with the icon in DesignMode</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
    <td>WindowSwitchTo()</td>
    <td>Menu|Window &gt;&gt; selectWindowItem</td>
    <td>Allows the Developer to switch to an open Child Window</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;">
    <td>...()</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>(many other UI API calls excluded)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  For this article, we shall only be working with and testing the <b>AddIcon()</b> and <b>RemoveIcon()</b> API calls.<p>

This functionality seems to be an ideal mapping of the model(s) in the FsCheck example to the Database System: instead of incrementing or decrementing a Counter, we will be adding/removing icons to a UI window.
<p>
  The approach being taken here is a baby step; once we get it working and have "tested the test setup" we can proceed to build more complicated Models and test other API calls, interleave calls, run them in batches, sequentially or in parallel, etc.
  <p>

<h3>A Note about the Production System</h3>
<p>
<center><img src="./assets/tuple.png" width='75%' style='border:1px solid'></center>
  <p>
For the test we are going to pass a 3-parameter tuple to the <b>DskStateMachine</b> ctor shown in the image above.
<p>
  The real system uses many more parameters, including: 
  <ul>
    <li><b>TableState</b> (DateTimeTableLastAccessed, DatabaseQueryString, UserMarkedRecords, ...)</li>
    <li><b>SessionState</b> (ClientType, LoginDateTime, AuthData, ...)</li>
    <li><b>UserState</b> (UserName, LicenseType, ClientID, ...)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The production system persists this state in a <b>Desktop.brj</b> file (sort of like Desktop.ini in Windows but binary) which is synched to the Backend Server.
    <p>
    Most of these extra parameters are irrelevant to our test (which only tests the icons) so instead of calling the production ctor I'll be calling a curried function which will fill in the missing parameters with default values.
    <p>
      Please also note that because the production system is commercial/copyrighted I can't share any proprietory code.  However, the gist <a href='https://google.com'>here</a> contains working code; I shall share the <b>results</b> of running the test on production and you shall have enough to customize the models and types to your own application.
      <p>


<h3>Hacking the FsCheck Example</h3>
  We are now ready to hack the example to incorporate our desired changes.
<br>
<h3>Connecting 2 the Production System</h3>
  Dir of snaps, move 2 end
<br>
<h3>Add Cmds 4 openWins</h3>
  Also renaming, poss; then chain em all.
